# Restaurant Reviews Project

## Project Overview

For this **Restaurant Reviews** project, I was provided a static webpage and tasked to convert it to an accessible, responsive mobile-ready web application that performs seamlessly offline- all while maintaining its original functionality. This project is an assignment a part of the Front-End Nanodegree Degree Program provided by Udacity.

## How to View/Set up

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most users, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

3. Explore the provided code to view the created experience including the responsive design, accessibility and offline use.


### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
